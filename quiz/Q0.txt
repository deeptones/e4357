	Keyboard senses keys pressed - issues an interrupt to
		USB or PS2 interface to Northbridge chipset
	
	This interrupt is relayed to processor.

	Processor recognizes context of "web browser" and relays
		key sequence to browser (Chrome, Safari, IE, etc.)

	Browser interprets html text as an entry and recognizes 
		a form has been completed.

	Browser causes CPU to look in hard drive - is the information cached?
	Hard drive is accessed through PCIe bus.

	if info not cached, send a message via TCP/IP via ethernet or 
		wifi network card.

		if ethernet, goes out through ethernet cable.
		if wifi - to wifi router.

	Info is packetized and sent to modem: 
		to adsl or cable or access router or switch.

	Packets travel through wifi network or cable / phone to ISP.

	Packets leave ISP to travel through backbone (eg. SONET.)

	At DNS server, if information is cached here, reverse route back to 
		user's host system.

	A human may power-cycle the data center, in which case data is 
		temporarily held and re-transmitted from last upstream 
		node.

	At Google server, the requested data gets hashed and database is 
		searched until matches are found.

	Matching site hits are bundled and transmitted in reverse direction to 
		user's PC.
